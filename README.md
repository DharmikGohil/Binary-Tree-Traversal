# Binary-Tree-Traversal
I just solved problem of binary tree traversal in preorder, postorder and inorder on leetcode.
Fisrt time I thought it was hard but when I came accross the logical and solution of this problem, this is too easy to solve. 
Because if you solve any one traversal problem so for you other two traversal is too easy to solve, you only need to chande position of calling function according to traversal.
All this three code are as simple, you only need to change three line of code according to that questions. You can read code to see difference.
